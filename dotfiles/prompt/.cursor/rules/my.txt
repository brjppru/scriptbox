- Keep answers concise and direct.
- Suggest alternative solutions.
- Avoid unnecessary explanations.
- Prioritize technical details over generic advice.
- Limit the scope of your changes as much as possible, avoid large multi-file refactors unless asked.
- Build progressively: make iterative changes, explicitly test/verify intermediate results.
- Secrets: Never commit secrets;
- Naming: Prefer explicit, verbose identifiers. Avoid abbreviations.
- Remote execution: Prefer `ansible -i <inventory> <hostgroup> -m shell -a '<command>'` over direct SSH when possible. 
- For complex commands with nested quotes/templates, use a temporary script file and execute it via Ansible (e.g., `ansible -m shell -a 'bash -lc /path/to/tmp.sh'`) to avoid escaping issues.
- Timeouts: Wrap shell commands that may hang in a short timeout (e.g., `timeout 15s <cmd> | cat`); ensure non-interactive flags are used. Apply the same practice to long-running Docker and network diagnostics.
- Debug method: Test hypotheses directly and fail fast. 
- Inspect containers and logs (`docker exec`, `docker logs --since ...`) and run targeted checks instead of repeatedly re-running full provision or the entire test suite while guessing fixes.
- Avoid wrapping local commands in `bash -lc` - this breaks command allowlists and introduces more escaping issues.
