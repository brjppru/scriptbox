```

## System Configuration

# PowerHour(tm)

### Sleeping

https://support.apple.com/en-us/120622

A Mac laptop with Apple silicon automatically turns on and starts up when you open its lid or connect it to power. With macOS Sequoia 15 or later, you can change this behavior without affecting your ability to use your keyboard or trackpad to turn on your Mac.

Make sure that your Mac laptop with Apple silicon is using macOS Sequoia or later.

Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.

Type one of these commands in Terminal, then press Return:

To prevent startup when opening the lid or connecting to power:

```bash
sudo nvram BootPreference=%00
```

To prevent startup only when opening the lid:

```bash
sudo nvram BootPreference=%01
```

To prevent startup only when connecting to power:

```bash
sudo nvram BootPreference=%02
```

Type your administrator password when prompted (Terminal doesn't show the password as it's typed), then press Return.

To undo any of the previous commands and reenable automatic startup when opening the lid or connecting to power, enter:

```bash
sudo nvram -d BootPreference
```

### DeepSleep

Got into the classic trap: close the MacBook at night, and in the morning it won't wake up without a charger. Macs these days just ain't what they used to be. In fact, I've got a ton of terminals, remote desktops and other toys that the Mac kindly remembers and wakes itself up for, all night long.

The trick is dead simple.
First, ask the Mac how often it wakes up:

```bash
pmset -g log | grep due
```

When you see it wakes up almost every minute, just tell it to stop keeping connections alive:

```bash
sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0
```

Result: the Mac survives the night losing only 1-2% battery. Downside: all connections drop, so after opening the lid you wait about a minute for the world to come back.

### Dock Customization

#### Add Dock Spacers

Regular spacer script:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'; killall Dock
```

Small spacer script:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="small-spacer-tile";}'; killall Dock
```

Move the spacer? Drag and drop the spacer to the desired location on your dock. You can delete spacers like any other icon on your dock. Drag the icon off your dock to remove it from your dock or right-click and choose Remove from Dock.

### File Attributes and App Signing

#### Special Installations
```bash
brew install alienator88/homebrew-cask/sentinel-app
```

#### Resign Apps and Remove Attributes

xattr -cr removes extended attributes (like quarantine flags) from the app to fix "damaged" errors. codesign --force --deep --sign - re-signs the app locally to resolve macOS signature issues. It's for fixing untrusted or non-Store apps.

```bash
/Applications/thebrj.app && codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/thebrj.app
```

or

```bash
Game="/Applications/xmind.app"
sudo xattr -c -r "$Game"
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "$Game"
sudo xattr -cr "$Game"
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "$Game"
chmod +x "$Game"
```

#### File Attributes (chattr)

chflags uchg file or nouchg -> Prevents changes to the file's contents or metadata. This is similar to the i attribute in chattr.

## Backup & Recovery

### macOS Reinstall

Use macOS recovery options to reinstall the Mac operating system. -> Apple Processor -> Press the power button to turn on your Mac, and continue holding it until the startup options window appears. Click the gear icon (Options menu), then click Continue.

### Boot Flash / Reinstall

```bash
softwareupdate --list-full-installers; echo; echo "Please enter version number you wish to download:"; read REPLY; [ -n "$REPLY" ] && softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version "$REPLY"
```

To create an installation USB drive, you need a USB drive of at least sixteen gigabytes. It needs to be formatted in Mac OS Extended Journaled file system with GUID partition table.

Open Disk Utility. In the View menu, select Show All Devices. Select the USB drive and click Erase. In the Name field, specify a name like MyUSB. In the Format field, select Mac OS Extended Journaled. In the Scheme field, select GUID Partition Map. Confirm deletion.

By default, Disk Utility only shows partitions -> press Cmd/Win+2 to show all devices (alternatively you can press the View button)

- installer docs -> https://support.apple.com/en-us/101578

```bash
softwareupdate --list-full-installers
softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 15.0
```

```bash
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sequoia.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /volumes/macos15 
```

### Startup Fixes

You likely have an extremely tiny file in /Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchDeamons that would launch someshit the background if required. Obviously it cant work now since you removed it but the tiny file is still present -> Open Finder -> Under locations select your macbook/macintosh HD/library/LaunchAgents AND also check LaunchDaemons
