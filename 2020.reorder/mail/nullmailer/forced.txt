As small replacement for postfix and the like, nullmailer has established on the one and other Linux home server тАУ such as mine. My specific problem with the provider/email relay: They check if the sender email address matches the relay account email address to prevent spam. ThatтАЩs a good feature, but nullmailer uses actual user@host, where host defaults to the content of /etc/mailname (e.g. root@myserver.dyndns.org or www-data@myserver.dyndns.org). Nullmailer has no rewrite functionality based on config files, but in the specific case a simple (but not completely accurate) solution can be applied:

# 1) Rename the original sendmail binary:
$ mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail-bin
 
# 2) Create and edit a script called sendmail:
$ touch /usr/sbin/sendmail
$ chmod 755 /usr/sbin/sendmail
Edit the sendmail script file and paste this content:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/sendmail-bin $@ -f `cat /etc/nullmailer/forced-from` </dev/stdin
The script simply forwards all arguments and the STDIN to the original sendmail, but adds the -f argument to replace the from address. In my case, I save the full sender address of the relay account in the file /etc/nullmailer/forced-from. ThatтАЩs it.

There are two things I did not test yet:

After done a test with PHP and тАЬsendmail -f www-dataтАЭ in the php.ini, I assume that the last тАЬ-f SENDER-EMAILтАЭ argument that occurs will be the used one. No idea if this will be that way for all time. The argument list will have to be filtered then.
What does the package manager/aptitude do with this when removing, updating, etc. (ThatтАЩs why I say not really accurate :-) )

/usr/sbin/sendmail-bin -f `cat /etc/nullmailer/forced-from` $@ </dev/stdin
