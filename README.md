# Why?

Just becouse (c)

Your GitHub profile usually works as a public career portfolio. It is a simple way to show your open source contributions to a potential employer or client. Because of this, for many people it becomes almost impossible to leave GitHub. Their professional image and opportunities are strongly connected to the platform.

In my case, I am lucky. These factors do not affect me much. I do not depend on GitHub Sponsors for income, and I do not run a large open source project with many contributors. Most of my repositories are small tools, scripts, or infrastructure code for my personal machines. For me, GitHub is useful, but it is not critical.

Also, the network effect will only start to weaken when people actually leave the platform. Nothing will change if everyone stays on GitHub and only complains about its decline or the lack of real alternatives. Real change requires action, not just frustration.

# Any plan?

* Reorder everything.
* Do not try this at home.
* That’s all.
