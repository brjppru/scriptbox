## Loki

I migrate to loki from freya, see old repo https://github.com/brjppru/freya

## Why use loki?

I still have a good old noname netbook purchased in 2011 
Noname Intel Atom N570(1.66), 2048, 320, WiFi, BT, Cam, 5300mAh.
In 2016 it's still worked about 4 hours on batt!

Setup today XP x32, Win7 x32m or thin pc, or win10 + chrome + antivirus + skype + dropbox makes me cry and cry tears of blood when I try to use wintel platform.
In any case, enough perhaps to the death of this notebook. 
That's all.
