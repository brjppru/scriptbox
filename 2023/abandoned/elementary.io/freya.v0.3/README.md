## Why use freya?

I have a good old noname netbook purchased in 2011 Intel Atom N570(1.66), 2048, 320, WiFi, BT, Cam, 5300mAh.
In 2015 it's still worked about 4 hours on batt! 
4 year ago... 
setup today XP x32, Win7 x32m or thin pc, or win10 + chrome + antivirus + skype + dropbox makes me cry and cry tears of blood when I try to use wintel platform.
too slowly. 
Freya is fast and being based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, supported until April 2019... 
in any case, enough perhaps to the death of this notebook. That's all.
