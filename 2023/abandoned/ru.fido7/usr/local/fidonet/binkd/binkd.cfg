# Define a link:
#       node [[z:]n/]n[.p][@domain] [-nr|-nd] [-md] [-ip] [{hosts|-} [{pwd|-} [flavour [{obox|-} [{ibox|-}]]]]]
#
# * All non-"-" fields will redefine values specified for the same node 
#	earlier in config. 
# * Flavour is one of i, c, d, -, h; and is the flavour for the outbound
# 	filebox ("obox"). 
# * Binkd sends from obox all non-dir entries NOT matching ".*" wildcard.
#	EVERY TIME YOU PUT A FILE INTO OBOX CHECK IF BINKD WILL BE ABLE TO
#	UNLINK IT. Otherwise, the session will never end.
# * Default for ibox is inbound or inbound-nosecure depending on the pwd field. 
# * Default for port is oport.
# * `-nr' stands for `Not Reliable Link', this works only on outbound calls 
#	with another binkp/1.1 mailer. The option solves the only problem with
#	binkd having no enough time to start receiving of a file from 
#	non-zero offset before IP link's down, so don't use it unless you 
#	have this problem -- really not effective
# * `-nd' means "No Dupe Mode", this works only on outbound calls with
#	another binkd 0.9.3 or higher. The option solves problem with
#	duplicating files while losts carrier but link is a bit slower
#	then with "-nr" option
# * `-md' means "Must have CRAM-MD5". This works only with nodes with
#       binkd or argus supported this method. Do not set it if your link
#       can use the old version of binkd.
# * `-nomd' - do not use CRAM-MD5 for this node (send plain text password)
# * `-ip' means "Restrict remote IP-address". In this case the node will
#       reject if it comes not from one of its addresses.
# * Hosts is a list in form
#       host1[:port1][;host2[:port2]] ...
# * Asterisk (`*') in the host list forces Binkd to perform
#       1:2/3.4 --> p4.f3.n2.z1.fidonet.net translation for a node's
#       Fido-address and lookup IP for the resulting FQDN in DNS.
#       Root domain part ("fidonet.net") can be changed with root-domain
#       keyword.

#
# Default node flags. Binkd will call unlisted node if "defnode" defined.
