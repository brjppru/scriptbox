IRC robot (nickname Tormoz) has been created for joke.
It's very funny bot that can make emulation itellect of human.
Brain of human isn't very difficult thing and it's bot can show
it.
Programm include two things -  perl script and plain text database
with association words. For example:
if anybody said to bot: "Hello Tormoz!", it's answered: "Hello , How 
are you feeling?".By the way, the tormoz-bot.tgz include little log of
the talk with bot somebody human. :-).

Sorry, but Tormoz include only russian database of words.
and so sorry for my english :)

With best regards,
