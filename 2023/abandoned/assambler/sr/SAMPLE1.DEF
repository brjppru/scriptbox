 seg:off type   options & label & comments
 -------  -- --------------------------------

        <<<<<  Insert new reference definitions here (start in column 1)



  Notes:
     1) Must have at least one entry in each section to operate properly.
          Use "none" if no entries are needed for a section.
          Separate each section with at least one line with a space in
          column 1.

     2) Order of entries within each section is unimportant.

     3) When a filename is specified in section 1, it is loaded and the
          first 250 segments can be referenced as "sega" to "segz" and
          "sgaa" to "sgaz" through to the 250th segment "sgio".  These can
          be used anywhere a segment is required.  For example a location
          label can be defined as:

                        6234:0124 loc, Ext, C 2  temp_value_a
                  or:   segb:0124 loc, Ext, C 2  temp_value_a

          The second entry will use the 2nd segment within the loaded file
          An error will be generated if a segment is used beyond those 
          specified by the file load (Consult manual for more information).

     4) Section 3 ignores blank lines or lines starting with a space in column
          1, or the balance of a line where a semicolon occurs.

     5) The following examples show acceptable forms for the same function,
          a location entry as a external entry point with comment #2:

             6234:0124 loc, Ext, C 2  temp_value_a
             6234:0124 l, Ext, C 2  temp_value_a
             6234:0124 l, E, C=2  temp_value_a      ;notes can follow
             6234:0124 l, External, C 2       temp_value_a
             6234:0124 Location, Ext, C 02   temp_value_a
             6234:0124 L, e, c 2 temp_value_a        

     6) Upper and lower case will have no effect (except for analysis flags),
          but is preserved for labels.
