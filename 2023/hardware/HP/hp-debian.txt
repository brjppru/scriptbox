Abbreviations: 
chassisname = ch
controller = ctrl 
logicaldrive = ld
physicaldrive = pd 
drivewritecache = dwc

There are two ways execute the command:

1. When you type the command hpacucli/hpssacli, it will display a “=>” prompt as shown below where you can enter all the hpacucli commands:

root@ximunix:~# hpssacli
HP Smart Storage Administrator CLI 2.10.14.0
Detecting Controllers...Done.
Type "help" for a list of supported commands.
Type "exit" to close the console.

=> ctrl all show

Smart Array P400 in Slot 1                (sn: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX)

=> quit

2. Or, if you don’t want to get to the hpacucli/hpssacli prompt, you can just enter the following directly in the Linux prompt:

root@ximunix:~# hpssacli ctrl all show

Smart Array P400 in Slot 1                (sn: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX)

Controller Commands
## Display detail of Controller
hpssacli ctrl all show config

## Display detail of Controller
hpssacli ctrl all show config detail

## Display status of Controller
hpssacli ctrl all show status

## Rescan for New Devices
hpssacli rescan

Physical Drive Commands
## Display detail information of all physical drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd all show

## Display detail information of single phiysical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd 2:3 show detail

## Display status of all physical drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd all show status

## Display status of single physical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd 2:3 show status

## To Erase the physical drive (WARN!)
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd 2:3 modify erase

## To enable the LED of a physical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd 2:3 modify led=on

## To disable the LED of a physical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 pd 2:3 modify led=off

Logical Drive Commands
## Display detail information of all logical drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld all show

## Display detail information of single logical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld 4 show

## Display status of all logical drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld all show status

## Display status of single logical drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld 4 show status

## Re-enabling failed drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld 4 modify reenable forced

## Create logical drive with RAID 0 using one drive
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 create type=ld drives=1:12 raid=0

## Create LogicalDrive with RAID 1 using two drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 create type=ld drives=1:13,1:14 size=300 raid=1

## Create LogicalDrive with RAID 5 using five drives
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 create type=ld drives=1:13,1:14,1:15,1:16,1:17 raid=5

## Delete a specific logical drive
hpssacli> ctrl slot=0 ld 4 delete

## Expanding a logical drive by adding two more drives
hpssacli> ctrl slot=0 ld 4 add drives=2I:1:6,2I:1:7

## Extending the logical drive
hpssacli> ctrl slot=0 ld 4 modify size=500 forced

## Add two spare disks
hpssacli> ctrl slot=0 array all add spares=2I:1:6,2I:1:7

Caching
## Enable Cache
if you have a battery pack installed but your Drive Write Cache is still shown as “Disabled”, you can enable it using the command:

root@ximunix:~# hpssacli ctrl slot=0 modify dwc=enable

Warning: Without the proper safety precautions, use of write cache on physical 
         drives could cause data loss in the event of power failure.  To ensure
         data is properly protected, use redundant power supplies and
         Uninterruptible Power Supplies. Also, if you have multiple storage
         enclosures, all data should be mirrored across them. Use of this
         feature is not recommended unless these precautions are followed.
         Continue? (y/n) y

Warning is self-explaining I guess. Disks's cache aren't protected by controller's battery. It's up to you but I wouldn't enable such features if your power supply isn't protected.

## Disable Cache
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 modify dwc=disable

## Modify Accelerator Ratio (read/write):
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 modify cacheratio=25/75

## Enable Array Acceleration for one of your logical drives use:
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld 4 modify aa=enable

## Enable Array Acceleration for all of your logical drives use:
hpssacli ctrl slot=0 ld all modify arrayaccelerator=enable

Generate Diagnost Report
hpssacli ctrl all diag file=/tmp/ADUreport.zip ris=on xml=on zip=on

To all the SysAdmin which always jump into this situation where you have to support HP ProLiant Servers under GNU/Debian and you don't find the Official Support from HP. Here are some tips&tricks.

WARNING: This blog, of course, does not infer official support from HP. Information on official HP support offerings for Debian can be found on http://hp.com/go/debian

Debian + bnx2 Firmware
First of all, and as how many of you know, to Install a new Debian on HP ProLiant servers, we need the bnx2 Firmware.
If you are a lazy SysAdmin like me, and you don't want to build the CD with Firmware by your own, there is a non-free Repo where you can find Debian including the bnx2 firmware:
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/

The cool thing of this, is that It Works!  ;)

Now, after you got your Debian pretty installed and running in your cool HP ProLiant server, here are some tools that you may need in your HP Box.

And then we download the GPG-KEY:

# corresponding to http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/faq.html:
wget http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/repo/mcp/GPG-KEY-mcp -O - | apt-key add -
apt-get update
 
OR
Add this line to your APT sources list:

# HP-TOOLS
deb http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/downloads/MCP/debian jessie/current non-free

Add HP-apt Key:
wget http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/downloads/MCP/GPG-KEY-mcp -O - | apt-key add -

Then run apt-get update and install any of the packages you might need.

Installing Individual Packages
 
HP System Health Application and Command line Utilities (hp-health)
The HP System Health Application and Command Line Utilities (hp-health) is a collection of applications and tools which enables monitoring of fans, power supplies, temperature sensors, and other management events. It also provides collection of command-line utilities: the ProLiant boot configuration utility (hpbootcfg), the ProLiant Management Command Line Interface Utility (hpasmcli), the ProLiant Integrated Management Log (IML) Utility (hplog), and the UID (blue) Light Utility (hpuid). To install the hp-health package, run:

apt-get install hp-health

Here we can have some interesting usage for hpasmcli:

root@anneke:~$ hpasmcli
HP management CLI for Linux (v1.0)
Copyright 2004 Hewlett-Packard Development Group, L.P.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Some hpasmcli commands may not be supported on all Proliant servers.
      Type 'help' to get a list of all top level commands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
hpasmcli> help
CLEAR  DISABLE  ENABLE  EXIT  HELP  NOTE  QUIT  REPAIR  SET  SHOW
hpasmcli>

As it can be seen in the above example several main tasks can be done, to get the usage of every command simply use HELP followed by the command.

hpasmcli> help show
USAGE: SHOW [ ASR | BOOT | DIMM | F1 | FANS | HT | IML | IPL | NAME | PORTMAP | POWERSUPPLY | PXE | SERIAL | SERVER | TEMP | UID | WOL ]
hpasmcli>
hpasmcli> HELP SHOW BOOT
USAGE: SHOW BOOT: Shows boot devices.
hpasmcli>

The scripting mode hpasmcli can be used directly from the shell prompt with the -s option and the command between quotation marks. It can be an easier way, or just a simple way to run some scripts or checks for the health status of our Servers. For example:

root@anneke:~$ hpasmcli -s "show server"

To configure the hp-snmp-agents package, run:

/sbin/hpsnmpconfig

Finally, restart the hp-snmp-agents service:

/etc/init.d/hp-snmp-agents restart

Note: In some configurations, the following message will be displayed when hp-snmp-agents starts:

    FATAL: Module sg not found.

This message can be safely ignored... (so it says HP :P )

HP System Management Homepage (hpsmh)
The HP System Management Homepage (hpsmh) provides a consolidated view for single server management highlighting tightly integrated management functionalities including performance, fault, security, diagnostic, configuration, and software change management. To install the hpsmh package, run:

apt-get install hpsmh

Note: You may see the following message the first time you attempt to install hpsmh:

I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/opt/hp/hpsmh/conf/smhpd.xml"

If you see this message, you will need to restart the hpsmh service before you can make use of it. To restart the hpsmh service, run:

/etc/init.d/hpsmhd restart

HP System Management Homepage Templates (hp-smh-templates)
The HP System Management Homepage Templates for Linux (hp-smh-templates) contains the System Management Homepage Templates for Server, Management processor, NIC and Storage subsystems. The templates are a collection of html, javascript and php files that act as a GUI to display the SNMP data provided by each subsystems agent(s). This package is dependant on the hp-snmp-agents package and also on the hpsmh package to serve the page s to the browser. To install the hp-smh-templates package, run:

apt-get install hp-smh-templates

HP Command Line Array Configuration Utility (hpacucli/hpssacli)
The Array Configuration Utility CLI (hpacucli) is a command line based disk configuration program that allows you to configure Smart Array Controllers and RAID Array Controllers.

For this special friend, we have another Repo which has the software more up2date!


Add this line to your APT sources list: (if the package is not already working with the previous repo (see at the beginning of the post))

deb http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/downloads/MCP jessie/current non-free

Packages are now signed, please run the following command after adding the repository to sources .list:
wget -O - http://downloads.linux.hpe.com/SDR/downloads/MCP/debian/dists/jessie/current/Release.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Now Run:
apt-get update
apt-get install hpssacli

And  for a quick guide of the commands of this tool, you can take a look on my special guide ;)
http://www.datadisk.co.uk/html_docs/redhat/hpacucli.htm

HP Array Configuration Utility (cpqacuxe)
The HP Array Configuration Utility (cpqacuxe) is a web-based disk configuration utility for HP array controllers. To install cpqacuxe package, run:

apt-get install cpqacuxe

To enable the use of the web-based Array Configuration Utility, you must first manually start the cpqacuxe service fro m the command line:

/usr/sbin/cpqacuxe


 Hope this helps to the lost souls that need some of these things!

If in your new freshly installed Debian Jessie you find the following error while running hpacucli:

ximena@xdev:~$ hpacucli ctrl all show status

Error: No controllers detected.

Don't break your brain and install "hpssacli" from the same repo:

ximena@xdev:~$ hpssacli ctrl all show config

Smart Array P440ar in Slot 0 (Embedded)   (sn: XXXXXXXXXXX)

   array A (SAS, Unused Space: 0  MB)
